# CHAPTER_1
# Introducing Flutter and Getting Started

In this chapter, I will show to you how the Flutter framework architecture works behind the scenes. You learned that Flutter is a great portable UI framework to build mobile applications for iOS and Android. Flutter also plans on supporting development for desktop, web, and embedded devices. You learned that Flutter applications are built from a single codebase that uses widgets to create the UI and that you develop with the Dart language. You learned that Flutter uses the Skia 2D rendering engine that works with different types of hardware and software. 
The Dart language is AOT compiled to native code, resulting in fast performance for your applications. You learned that Dart is JIT compiled, making it fast to display code changes with Flutterâ€™s stateful hot reload. 
The widgets are the building blocks for composing the UI, and each widget is an immutable declaration of the UI. Widgets are the configuration to create elements. Elements are the widgets made concrete, meaning mounted and painted on the screen. You learned that the RenderObject implements the basic layout and paint protocols.
